### Experiences
- #### M.Tech Researcher ( ML & Cloud ) | Central University of Karnataka ( Aug 2021 - Present ) <br>
    -- Working on the **solar energy generation forecasting using Hybrid methods** and its deployment in the **Heroku cloud platform** . The motive of this research is to enhance the accuracy of the existing state of the art forecasting models using new emerging techniques and create a user interface for others to interact with my model .
    
- #### Project Intern ( Reinforcement Learning ) | Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee ( Dec 2020 - Jun 2021 ) <br>
    -- Worked on the project titled " **Trajectory Planning of Robotic Arm Using Reinforcement Learning " using UR5 robotic Arm by the Universal Robots** .<br>
    -- Worked and applied **Q-learning algorithm** to make the tip of UR5 to move in a circular trajectory using **openai_ros package in Robotic Operating System ( ROS) Kinetic version** .<br>
    -- **Trained the reinforcement learning agent for 6-7 hours** in the online the Contruct platform and found the agent to learn .<br>

- #### Summer Research Intern ( Computer Vision ) | National Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh (May 2020 - Aug 2020 ) <br>
    -- Designed and developed an **Automatic License Plate detection and Recognition system for Rural India** with specific design constraints of being deployable in a **Raspberry Pi** , working **without interne**t connectivity and build using **Open Source** . <br>

    -- Applied **Tesseract OCR** for License plate recognition and was able to **improve its accuracy by 30% - 40% using image processing techniques.** <br>

    -- Deployed **YOLO v4 model** having weight size of **244 MB** in Raspberry Pi 3 B of **1GB RAM** using **Darknet framework** . <br>
