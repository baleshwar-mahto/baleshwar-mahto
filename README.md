### Experiences
- #### Junior Software Engineer ( Autonomous Navigation ) | Aegeus Technologies , Bangalore , India ( Feb 2023 - Present ) <br>
  **1. Shreem Autonomous Robot :**<br>
-- Independently implemented Epsilon Star algorithm in Python for online coverage path planning of unknown environment to navigate autonomously in an inclined rectangular island of solar panels . <br>
-- Done research work and read research papers in related domains and suggested optimal method for development . <br>
-- Derived mathematically the angle of inclined solar panels with ground in terms of roll and pitch angles provided by IMU ( Inertial Measurement Unit ) sensor to compute the required traction for auto-hold functionality on inclined solar panels . <br>

  **2. Shreem Remote Controlled ( RC ) Robot :**<br>
-- Created the initial documentation for the Shreem Remote controlled robot through reverse engineering .<br>

  **3. Unicorn Fully-automatic Robot :**<br>
-- Assisted Lead Engineer in troubleshooting 42 control panels ( Control Unit ) of the Unicorn fully-automatic robot .<br>
-- Created root cause analysis ( RCA ) report on the failures of the control panels at that specific site and suggested optimal methods to further stablize it .<br>
-- Contributed code to multiple Unicorn robot related projects for new features enhancement and enabling wireless communication between the robot and remote monitoring station . (Modbus RTU & LoRaWAN ) 

- #### M.Tech Researcher ( ML & Cloud ) | Central University of Karnataka ( Aug 2021 - July 2022 ) <br>
    -- Working on the **solar energy generation forecasting using Hybrid methods** and its deployment in the **Heroku cloud platform** . The motive of this research is to enhance the accuracy of the existing state of the art forecasting models using new emerging techniques and create a user interface for others to interact with my model .
    
- #### Project Intern ( Reinforcement Learning ) | Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee ( Dec 2020 - Jun 2021 ) <br>
    -- Worked on the project titled " **Trajectory Planning of Robotic Arm Using Reinforcement Learning " using UR5 robotic Arm by the Universal Robots** .<br>
    -- Worked and applied **Q-learning algorithm** to make the tip of UR5 to move in a circular trajectory using **openai_ros package in Robotic Operating System ( ROS) Kinetic version** .<br>
    -- **Trained the reinforcement learning agent for 6-7 hours** in the online the Contruct platform and found the agent to learn .<br>

- #### Summer Research Intern ( Computer Vision ) | National Institute of Technology, Andhra Pradesh (May 2020 - Aug 2020 ) <br>
    -- Designed and developed an **Automatic License Plate detection and Recognition system for Rural India** with specific design constraints of being deployable in a **Raspberry Pi** , working **without interne**t connectivity and build using **Open Source** . <br>

    -- Applied **Tesseract OCR** for License plate recognition and was able to **improve its accuracy by 30% - 40% using image processing techniques.** <br>

    -- Deployed **YOLO v4 model** having weight size of **244 MB** in Raspberry Pi 3 B of **1GB RAM** using **Darknet framework** . <br>
- #### Design Innovation Center ( DIC) Intern | Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (Dec 2019 ) <br> 
    **Discrete-time Sliding Mode Controller Design :**<br>
    -- Researched about the latest papers on sliding mode control . Designed a discrete-time sliding mode controller for a two-wheeled mobile robot , which is a kind of autonomous guided vehicle , for path tracking of basic paths , namely circular path and straight line path .
